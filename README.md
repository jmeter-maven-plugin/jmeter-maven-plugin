#JMeter Maven Plugin

---

The JMeter Maven Plugin allows you to automate JMeter tests in Maven.

Current Version In Maven Central: **1.10.1** See the [release notes](https://github.com/Ronnie76er/jmeter-maven-plugin/wiki/Release-Notes) for change information.  This plugin requires **JDK 1.6** or higher.

---

**PLEASE NOTE:** _The Group ID and Artifact ID have changed since version 1.4!_

This is to bring the project in line with maven naming practice for non-maven plugins and to enable us to upload to the Sonatype OSS repository.  This project is now in the maven central repository.

#Basic Usage
-----

### Add the plugin to your project

* Add the plugin to the build section of your pom's project :

		<plugin>
			<groupId>com.lazerycode.jmeter</groupId>
			<artifactId>jmeter-maven-plugin</artifactId>
			<version>1.10.1</version>
			<executions>
				<execution>
					<id>jmeter-tests</id>
					<phase>verify</phase>
					<goals>
						<goal>jmeter</goal>
					</goals>
			   </execution>
			</executions>
		</plugin>

### Reference JMX files

Once you have created your JMeter tests, you'll need to copy them to `<Project Dir>/src/test/jmeter`.  By default this plugin will pick up all the .jmx files in that directory, to specify which tests should be run please see the project documentation.

### Run the tests

	`mvn verify`

All your tests will run in maven!
