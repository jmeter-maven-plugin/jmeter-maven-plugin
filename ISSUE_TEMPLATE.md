When reporting an issue:

- Please supply the versions of Java, JMeter, Maven and the JMeter-Maven-Plugin that you are using..
- Ideally provide a small minimal project that reproduces your issue.  As an absolute minimum we will require a pom.xml that shows your setup and any relevant logs (e.g. jmeter.log, maven logs).
- List the reproduction steps clearly:
    - What should happen (OK Case).
    - What actually happens (KO Case).
    - What steps you take to produce this problem.

Please answer any questions asked by the person looking into your issue.  If you don't respond the issue may be closedoff without being fixed as we are unable to reproduce it.

Issues should be related to bugs/feature requests.  Please don't raise an issue asking how to do something that is already documented.  If you have a question on how to use this plugin please look through the following first:
- The user manual on our [WIKI](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/wiki).
